### Section I Intuition Coach
- For each option, ask: “Does this statement move the **right curve** in the **right direction**?”
- In macro accounting items, distinguish identities (always true) from behavioral statements (usually true).
- In labor questions, the phrase “actively searching” is the switch that moves someone into unemployment.
- For elasticity questions, classification is based on absolute value, while sign still carries direction.

## Section II: Graphing and Market Analysis

### 13) Electricity Price Cap
1. Correct graph with P*=0.20, Q*=500, ceiling at 0.15.
2. Binding (0.15 < 0.20).
3. Shortage = 560 - 430 = 130 million kWh.
4. Any two: brownouts/rationing, waiting/priority queues, lower service quality, informal side contracts.
5. Supply subsidy (right shift) reduces shortage.

### 14) Wheat Market Two-Shock
1. Supply left (higher costs), demand right (population growth).
2. Price rises.
3. Quantity ambiguous due to opposing effects on Q.
4. Ceteris paribus: isolate each shock separately before combining results.

## Section III: Quantitative Problems

### 15) National Accounts and Deflator
Data:
- 2025: streaming 100x1500, furniture 400x220
- 2026: streaming 110x1620, furniture 440x236

1. Nominal GDP
- 2025: 100*1500 + 400*220 = 150,000 + 88,000 = 238,000
- 2026: 110*1620 + 440*236 = 178,200 + 103,840 = 282,040

2. Real GDP (base 2025)
- Real 2025 = 238,000
- Real 2026 = 100*1620 + 400*236 = 162,000 + 94,400 = 256,400

3. Real growth
- (256,400 - 238,000)/238,000 = 7.73%

4. Deflator and inflation
- Deflator 2025 = 100.00
- Deflator 2026 = (282,040 / 256,400)*100 = 110.00
- Inflation = 10.00%

### 16) Labor Market Metrics
Given adults 220, E=136, U=12 (millions)

1. LF = 148
2. u = 12/148 = 8.11%
3. LFPR = 148/220 = 67.27%
4. EPOP = 136/220 = 61.82%
5. If 4 million unemployed stop searching:
- U=8, LF=144
- New u = 8/144 = 5.56%

### 17) Saving and NX
Given Y=7000, C=4700, T=1200, G=1500, I=980

1. Savings:
- Sp = 7000 - 4700 - 1200 = 1100
- Sg = 1200 - 1500 = -300
- S = 800

2. NX = S - I = 800 - 980 = -180

3. Trade deficit (NX < 0)

4. Higher r:
- C tends to fall
- I tends to fall

## Section IV: Short Concept Responses

### 18) Elasticity + Revenue
1. Elasticity approx = -2% / 5% = -0.40
2. Inelastic (absolute value < 1)
3. Revenue rises when price rises under inelastic demand.

### 19) Production, Returns, and Policy
1. If K and L both double, Y doubles.
2. Constant returns to scale.
3. Valid policies: R&D support, education/human capital, innovation incentives, technology diffusion policy; mechanism is higher productivity parameter A.

## Intuition Debrief (How to Think Fast Under Time Pressure)
- **Price caps/floors:** quantity constraints appear first; non-price rationing appears second.
- **Deflator vs CPI:** deflator tracks domestic production prices; CPI tracks consumer cost of living.
- **Unemployment and participation interact:** discouragement can lower measured unemployment while labor slack remains.
- **Saving identity:** \(S = I + NX\) is an accounting mirror of domestic and external financing.
- **Production logic:** one-input increases face diminishing returns; broad productivity gains require better technology or organization.
