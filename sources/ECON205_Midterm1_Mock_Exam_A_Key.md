### Section I Intuition Coach
- Most MC errors come from **mechanism confusion**: ask what variable is exogenous and what variable adjusts.
- For supply/demand items, first classify as **movement along** (own price changed) versus **curve shift** (any non-price driver changed).
- For labor items, memorize denominators: unemployment always uses **labor force**, not population.
- For macro identities, treat equations as accounting truths, not theories: they must balance by construction.

## Section II: Graphing and Market Analysis

### 13) Urban Rental Market
1. Correct graph: downward D, upward S, equilibrium at (1800, 40k), horizontal ceiling at 1500.
2. Binding (1500 < 1800).
3. Shortage = QD - QS = 49,000 - 31,000 = 18,000 units.
4. Any two: waitlists, quality decline, side payments/black markets, stronger screening/rationing.
5. Supply right shift reduces shortage (may not fully eliminate it).

### 14) Two-Shock Coffee Market
1. Supply shifts left (cost shock), demand shifts right (preference shock).
2. Price rises unambiguously.
3. Quantity ambiguous because demand-right raises Q while supply-left lowers Q.
4. Ceteris paribus: analyze each shift separately, then combine.

## Section III: Quantitative Problems

### 15) National Accounts and Deflator
Data:
- 2025: Tablet 500x120, Gym 50x900
- 2026: Tablet 550x132, Gym 55x960

1. Nominal GDP
- 2025: 500*120 + 50*900 = 60,000 + 45,000 = 105,000
- 2026: 550*132 + 55*960 = 72,600 + 52,800 = 125,400

2. Real GDP (base 2025 prices)
- Real 2025 = 105,000
- Real 2026 = 500*132 + 50*960 = 66,000 + 48,000 = 114,000

3. Real growth
- (114,000 - 105,000) / 105,000 = 0.0857 = 8.57%

4. Deflator and inflation
- Deflator 2025 = (105,000 / 105,000)*100 = 100.00
- Deflator 2026 = (125,400 / 114,000)*100 = 110.00
- Inflation = (110.00 - 100.00)/100.00 = 10.00%

### 16) Labor Market Metrics
Given adults 200, employed 124, unemployed 10 (millions).

1. LF = E + U = 124 + 10 = 134 million
2. Unemployment rate = 10/134 = 7.46%
3. LFPR = 134/200 = 67.00%
4. EPOP = 124/200 = 62.00%
5. If 2 million unemployed stop searching:
- New U = 8, new LF = 132
- New unemployment rate = 8/132 = 6.06%

### 17) Saving-Investment and Interest Channels
Given Y=6200, C=4100, T=1100, G=1300, I=850

1. Savings:
- Private Sp = Y - C - T = 6200 - 4100 - 1100 = 1000
- Public Sg = T - G = 1100 - 1300 = -200
- National S = Sp + Sg = 800

2. NX from S = I + NX:
- NX = S - I = 800 - 850 = -50

3. NX negative means trade deficit.

4. Higher real interest rate:
- Consumption: tends to fall (higher cost of consuming today)
- Investment: tends to fall (higher cost of borrowing)

## Section IV: Short Concept Responses

### 18) Elasticity + Revenue
1. Elasticity approx = -12% / 8% = -1.5
2. Elastic (absolute value > 1)
3. Revenue falls: quantity falls proportionally more than price rises.

### 19) Production and Growth
For Y = A*K^0.5*L^0.5:
1. If K doubles (A, L fixed), Y multiplies by sqrt(2) approx 1.41.
2. Output rises less than proportionally with K -> diminishing marginal returns to K.
3. Valid policy examples: R&D tax credits, public research funding, stronger education/human capital pipeline; channel is higher innovation/diffusion raising A.

## Intuition Debrief (How to Think Fast Under Time Pressure)
- **Price controls:** if policy pushes price away from market-clearing price, quantity must be rationed by queues, quality, search, or side payments.
- **Elasticity and revenue:** revenue moves with the side (price or quantity) that adjusts more in percentage terms.
- **Real vs nominal:** nominal mixes prices and quantities; real isolates quantity; deflator is the bridge between them.
- **Saving and NX:** if national saving is below investment, foreign saving fills the gap and NX is negative.
- **Production functions:** changing one input with others fixed tests marginal returns; scaling all inputs tests returns to scale.
