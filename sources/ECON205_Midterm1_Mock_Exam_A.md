## Section II: Graphing and Market Analysis (20 points)

### 13) Urban Rental Market (10 points)
Initial equilibrium: rent P* = 1800, quantity Q* = 40,000 units.

2. Is policy binding? (1)
3. Compute shortage. (2)
4. Give two likely non-price outcomes. (2)
5. If a housing-construction subsidy shifts supply right, what happens to shortage? (1)

### 14) Two-Shock Coffee Market (10 points)
Shock 1: Drought raises coffee bean costs.  
Shock 2: Popular health study increases demand for coffee.

Tasks:
1. Draw both shifts on one graph. (4)
2. Effect on equilibrium price. (2)
3. Effect on equilibrium quantity (and why). (3)
4. Brief ceteris paribus note. (1)

## Section III: Quantitative Problems (40 points)

### 15) National Accounts and Deflator (16 points)
Economy produces only tablets and gym memberships.

Tasks:
1. Compute nominal GDP in 2025 and 2026. (4)
2. Using 2025 as base year, compute real GDP in 2025 and 2026. (4)
3. Compute real GDP growth (2025->2026). (4)
4. Compute GDP deflator in both years and inflation via deflator. (4)

### 16) Labor Market Metrics (12 points)
Adult population = 200 million  
Employed = 124 million  
Unemployed = 10 million

Tasks:
1. Compute labor force. (2)
2. Compute unemployment rate. (3)
3. Compute LFPR. (3)
4. Compute employment-population ratio. (2)
5. If 2 million unemployed stop searching, recompute unemployment rate. (2)

Given: Y = 6200, C = 4100, T = 1100, G = 1300, I = 850

Tasks:
1. Compute private saving, public saving, national saving. (6)
2. Compute NX implied by S = I + NX. (2)
3. State whether the economy runs trade deficit/surplus. (2)
