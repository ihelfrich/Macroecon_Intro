# ECON 205 Midterm 1 - Master Study Tool

Course: USC ECON 205 (Spring 2026)  
Instructor: Andres Perez Corsini  
Built from: Syllabus + Lectures 01-07 (+ class exercise style)

## 0) Midterm 1 Scope Snapshot

Based on the posted course outline, Midterm 1 comes after Lectures 01-07 and before Lecture 08 (Money and Inflation).

Core scope:
1. Supply and Demand model
2. Applications: price ceilings/floors, elasticities, revenue
3. Macroeconomic concepts (GDP, growth, fluctuations, unemployment, inflation, interest rates)
4. National accounts (spending, income, value-added approaches)
5. Nominal vs real GDP, growth rates, GDP deflator, inflation measurement
6. Spending shares, saving, investment, interest-rate channels
7. Labor market definitions and measurement
8. Production, productivity, growth, marginal returns, returns to scale, technology

Likely lower priority for Midterm 1:
- Detailed monetary/fiscal policy tools from later lectures
- Open-economy policy units scheduled after midterm

## 0.1) Intuition Operating System (Use This on Every Question)

When you get a new problem, run this exact sequence:
1. **Classify the shock**: demand-side, supply-side, measurement, or policy constraint.
2. **Identify the margin that adjusts**: price, quantity, composition, or participation.
3. **Separate identity from behavior**: identities must hold; behavior determines which variable moves.
4. **Name the transmission channel** in one sentence: "because X changed, Y responds through Z."
5. **Sanity-check direction and denominator**: signs, units, and ratio denominators catch most errors.

If your answer does not include a mechanism, it is probably incomplete even if arithmetic is correct.

## 1) Lecture-by-Lecture High-Yield Map

## L01 - Supply and Demand

Must know:
- Law of demand: price up -> quantity demanded down
- Law of supply: price up -> quantity supplied up
- Shift vs movement along curve
- Equilibrium, shortage, surplus, self-correction

Demand shifters:
- Preferences
- Information
- Income
- Number of consumers
- Prices of substitutes/complements

Supply shifters:
- Technology
- Input prices
- Number of firms
- Expected future price
- Taxes/subsidies/regulation

Exam trap:
- Price change alone does not shift demand/supply; it moves along a curve.

## L02 - Applications + Elasticity

Price controls:
- Binding price ceiling (below equilibrium): shortage
- Binding price floor (above equilibrium): surplus
- Non-binding controls: no market effect

Midpoint elasticity template:
- $\varepsilon = \frac{\frac{X_2 - X_1}{(X_2 + X_1)/2}}{\frac{Y_2 - Y_1}{(Y_2 + Y_1)/2}}$

Core elasticities:
- Own-price elasticity of demand: usually negative
- Own-price elasticity of supply: usually positive
- Income elasticity of demand: normal (>0), inferior (<0)

Revenue relation:
- Elastic demand: price up -> revenue down
- Inelastic demand: price up -> revenue up
- Unit elastic: revenue roughly unchanged

## L03 - Macroeconomic Concepts

Definitions:
- Real GDP: inflation-adjusted output
- Business cycle: peak, recession, trough, recovery/expansion
- Unemployment rate: unemployed / labor force
- Inflation: sustained rise in price level
- Real interest rate: nominal interest - expected inflation

Big conceptual split:
- Short run fluctuations: aggregate demand side
- Long run growth: production capacity (A, K, L)

## L04 - National Accounts

Three equivalent GDP approaches:
1. Spending: $Y = C + I + G + NX$
2. Income: wages + profits + depreciation + taxes +/- adjustments
3. Value-added: sum of value added across production stages

Final vs intermediate goods:
- GDP counts final output to avoid double-counting.

Investment subcomponents:
- Business fixed
- Inventory
- Residential

Net exports:
- $NX = X - M$
- $NX > 0$ surplus, $NX < 0$ deficit

## L05 - Spending Shares, Saving, Investment

Shares:
- Consumption share: $\frac{C}{Y}$
- Investment share: $\frac{I}{Y}$
- Government share: $\frac{G}{Y}$
- Net export share: $\frac{NX}{Y}$

Interest-rate channels:
- Higher r -> lower current C, lower I, higher saving
- Higher domestic r -> currency appreciation -> NX tends to fall

Saving identities:
- Private saving: $S_p = Y - C - T$
- Public saving: $S_g = T - G$
- National saving: $S = S_p + S_g = Y - C - G$
- Open economy: $S = I + NX$

## L06 - Labor Market

Status categories:
- Employed
- Unemployed (not working, actively searching)
- Not in labor force

Formulas:
- Labor force: $\text{LF} = E + U$
- Unemployment rate: $u = \frac{U}{\text{LF}}$
- Labor force participation rate: $\text{LFPR} = \frac{\text{LF}}{\text{adult population}}$
- Employment-population ratio: $\text{EPOP} = \frac{E}{\text{adult population}}$

Types of unemployment:
- Frictional
- Structural
- Cyclical
- Seasonal

Natural rate:
- Mostly frictional + structural

## L07 - Production, Productivity, Growth

Production function:
- $Y = F(A, K, L)$

Productivity:
- Labor productivity: $\frac{Y}{L}$
- Capital productivity: $\frac{Y}{K}$

Marginal returns to one input:
- Diminishing / constant / increasing

Returns to scale (all inputs move proportionally):
- Diminishing / constant / increasing

Role of technology (A):
- Long-run growth engine
- Policy links: R&D support, innovation incentives, human capital

## 1.1) Intuition Anchors by Topic (High-Yield Causal Logic)

### Supply and Demand
- Prices are a coordination device. If policy blocks that device, coordination happens through queues, quality, and search friction instead.
- Curve shifts change the whole plan set; movement along a curve is just re-optimization at a new own price.

### Elasticity and Revenue
- Elasticity measures **behavioral flexibility**.
- Revenue rises with price only when buyers cannot reduce quantity much (inelastic demand).

### GDP and Deflator
- Nominal GDP answers: "How many dollars of output were transacted?"
- Real GDP answers: "How much physical output changed?"
- The deflator links the two by isolating domestic output prices.

### Saving, Investment, and NX
- National saving is the domestic funds available for investment.
- If domestic saving is short of domestic investment, the difference is foreign financing and appears as negative \(NX\).

### Labor Market
- Unemployment is not "not working"; it is "not working + actively searching."
- Participation and unemployment can move in opposite directions when discouraged workers exit search.

### Growth and Production
- Increasing one input with others fixed leads to diminishing marginal gains.
- Long-run living standards require productivity growth, not just temporary factor accumulation.

## 2) Formula Sheet (Memorize + Use Fast)

1. $Y = C + I + G + NX$
2. $NX = X - M$
3. Nominal GDP growth: $\frac{\text{Nom}_t - \text{Nom}_{t-1}}{\text{Nom}_{t-1}}$
4. Real GDP growth: $\frac{\text{Real}_t - \text{Real}_{t-1}}{\text{Real}_{t-1}}$
5. GDP deflator: $\frac{\text{Nominal GDP}}{\text{Real GDP}} \times 100$
6. Deflator inflation: $\frac{\text{Def}_t - \text{Def}_{t-1}}{\text{Def}_{t-1}}$
7. Real interest rate: $r \approx i - \pi^e$
8. $\text{LF} = E + U$
9. $u = \frac{U}{\text{LF}}$
10. $\text{LFPR} = \frac{\text{LF}}{\text{adults}}$
11. $\text{EPOP} = \frac{E}{\text{adults}}$
12. $S_p = Y - C - T$
13. $S_g = T - G$
14. $S = S_p + S_g = Y - C - G$
15. $S = I + NX$
16. Midpoint demand elasticity:
    $\varepsilon_D = \frac{\frac{Q_2-Q_1}{(Q_2+Q_1)/2}}{\frac{P_2-P_1}{(P_2+P_1)/2}}$
17. Annualized growth over n years:
    $g = \left(\frac{X_t}{X_0}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}} - 1$

## 3) Graphing Toolkit (How to Score Full Points)

When asked to graph:
1. Label axes first (P vertical, Q horizontal).
2. Draw initial `D0`, `S0`, equilibrium `(P0, Q0)`.
3. Shift only relevant curve(s): left = decrease, right = increase.
4. Mark new equilibrium `(P1, Q1)`.
5. Add one sentence: shock -> shift -> outcome.

Price control graphs:
- Ceiling: horizontal line below equilibrium, show shortage $Q_D - Q_S$
- Floor: horizontal line above equilibrium, show surplus $Q_S - Q_D$

Two-shock graphs:
- Analyze one shift at a time, then combine.
- Often price is clear and quantity is ambiguous (or vice versa) depending on shifts.

## 4) Top 25 Mistakes to Avoid

1. Confusing demand shift with quantity demanded change
2. Counting used goods in GDP
3. Counting financial asset purchases as GDP production
4. Forgetting residential construction is investment
5. Mixing nominal and real growth formulas
6. Forgetting deflator base-year value is 100
7. Using wrong denominator for unemployment rate (must be labor force)
8. Calling discouraged workers unemployed (they are out of labor force)
9. Getting sign wrong on income elasticity for inferior goods
10. Ignoring absolute value when classifying demand elasticity
11. Reversing revenue-elasticity relationship
12. Treating transfers as government purchases in GDP
13. Ignoring NX sign when interpreting trade balance
14. Forgetting $S = I + NX$ in open economy
15. Arithmetic mistakes in midpoint formula
16. Forgetting units (millions/billions)
17. Not labeling old vs new equilibrium in graphs
18. Missing ceteris paribus in explanations
19. Confusing marginal returns with returns to scale
20. Claiming one-input increase proves returns to scale
21. Forgetting technology can shift production upward
22. Confusing real and nominal wage
23. Treating cyclical unemployment as natural unemployment
24. Writing policy answers with no transmission channel
25. Leaving final answers unlabeled

## 5) Worked Examples (Exam-Style)

### Example 1: Binding Rent Ceiling
Given equilibrium rent $P^* = 2000$, ceiling $P_c = 1600$, and at ceiling $Q_D = 62$, $Q_S = 42$ (thousand):
- Binding? Yes ($1600 < 2000$)
- Shortage: $62 - 42 = 20$ thousand
- Likely outcomes: waiting lists, quality decline, side payments
- Intuition checkpoint: below-clearing price means too many buyers and too few units offered, so rationing shifts away from price.

### Example 2: Price Elasticity (Midpoint)
Price rises $10 \rightarrow 14$, quantity demanded falls $120 \rightarrow 80$:
- $\%\Delta Q = \frac{80-120}{100} = -0.4$
- $\%\Delta P = \frac{14-10}{12} = 0.3333$
- $\varepsilon_D = \frac{-0.4}{0.3333} = -1.20$ (elastic)
- Intuition checkpoint: buyers cut quantity proportionally more than price rose, so demand is price-sensitive.

### Example 3: Revenue + Elasticity
If demand is elastic and price rises, revenue falls because quantity drops proportionally more.
- Intuition checkpoint: revenue is price times quantity; elastic demand makes quantity the dominant moving part.

### Example 4: GDP Spending Approach
Given $C=17362.5$, $I=4625.1$, $G=4446.3$, $NX=-972.6$:
- $Y = 17362.5 + 4625.1 + 4446.3 - 972.6 = 25461.3$
- Intuition checkpoint: GDP is a spending decomposition, so every final-demand dollar must sit in exactly one component bucket.

### Example 5: Deflator Inflation
If deflator is $150$ in 2019 and $146.15$ in 2020:
- Inflation $= \frac{146.15 - 150}{150} = -2.57\%$ (deflation)
- Intuition checkpoint: falling deflator means domestic output prices fell on average, even if some individual prices rose.

### Example 6: Labor Market Metrics
Adults=40, employed=30, unemployed=5:
- $\text{LF}=35$
- $u=\frac{5}{35}=14.29\%$
- $\text{LFPR}=\frac{35}{40}=87.5\%$
- $\text{EPOP}=\frac{30}{40}=75\%$
- Intuition checkpoint: unemployment and participation are different margins; you must track both to read labor slack correctly.

### Example 7: Saving Identity
Given $Y=5000$, $C=3200$, $G=1000$, $T=950$, $I=900$, $NX=-100$:
- $S_p=5000-3200-950=850$
- $S_g=950-1000=-50$
- $S=800$
- $I+NX=900-100=800$ (identity holds)
- Intuition checkpoint: \(NX\) is the balancing item once domestic saving and investment are pinned down.

### Example 8: Production Function
If $Y = A K^{0.5} L^{0.5}$, with $A, L$ fixed and $K$ doubles:
- $Y$ multiplies by $\sqrt{2}$ $\rightarrow$ diminishing marginal return to $K$.

If both $K$ and $L$ double:
- $Y$ doubles $\rightarrow$ constant returns to scale.
- Intuition checkpoint: one-input experiments test marginal productivity; all-input scaling tests technology shape.
